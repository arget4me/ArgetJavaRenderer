LevelEditor:

: Draw solid rectangle //RED
: Draw solid rectangle, solid from top //BLUE
: Map tiles to rectangles from image, makes the largest rectangle //RED, BLUE IMAGE
: Edit rectangles: drag corners, delete.
: Eraser button
* Test play button -> Disables all editor logic handles simple sideScroller movement of square.
* freeform testplay - no collision.
: Top-down movement test play option.
* Top-down restricted tile movement.
: Save / Load TileMap.
: Fix bug when erasing blue rectangles. Removes extra rectangles. SOLVED: had forgot to do the same thing for blueRectangles as for Red.
* Layers:
: Separate entity layer similar to tilemap, and save in the same file after the tilemap data.
* Copy tile/entity under mouse from key binding/ middle mouse click.
* Fill tool.
* Paint multiple tiles option.
: FIXED! Bug: Eraser doesn't work on entities. //didn't work for entities because it checked the tiles array and not the entities array.
* Idea: Define extra data for entities. (is boss, text, hostile etc.)
//* Combine rectangles that are side by side.

TileMap:
: Should it handle/check collision? How is blue and red rectangles handled? (Blue: solid from top. Red: full solid). 
: Load from file
: Should allow collision option to include or ignore blue-solid rectangles.

Renderer2D:
: Don't loop through pixels that are renderer outside of buffer. Handles camera also.
: Improves performance for larger images and rectangles.

Image2D:
: able to load images that are builded with program without needing "res" folder next to jar.

TextRenderer:
* Different spacing for wide and thin characters. Maybe calculate directly from sprite.

Rectangle:
: Collision bug. checked bottom left corner of "other"-rectangle wrongly. accidentally checked (other.y + other.width -1) instead of (other.y + other.height -1)

Gameloop:
:QuickFix: Bug - Loop speeds up after a frame drop.
* Bug - toggleFullscreen doesn't work on mac.
