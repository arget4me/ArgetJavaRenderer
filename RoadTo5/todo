Bugs:
* Sound spams when jumping is interrupted early. Jumping in a small space or under a solid platform.
* Game sometimes crashes when shooting characters, negative index in char array.
* Game crashes if map doesn't have player and/or boss. Should load dummy map instead.

To be implemented:
* Cutscenes.
* More bosses.
* More levels.
* Options menu. control master sound.
* Powerups / pickups. -> Add buff. Permanent or over time.
* Campaign menu. - level order and cutscenes.
* More decorative tiles: wall, windows.

Ideas:
* Line of sight for entities/bosses/player. "Fog of war?"
* Puzzles, pickups/powers that interact with surrounding.
* Boss entities that doesn't trigger level victory.
* Tile/Entities that trigger defeat: "Lava"-"Hurt Tile", "Death Tile",
